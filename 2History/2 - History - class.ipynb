    "In this in-class activity, we examine a recently published paper to understand the purpose of elections in different political regimes. The paper [\"Democratic Pieces: Autocratic Elections and Democratic Development since 1815\" by Michael K. Miller](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/democratic-pieces-autocratic-elections-and-democratic-development-since-1815/63329F4F2908DAB4D0FAB53EF73F0D6E) explores how elections in autocratic regimes influence the transition to democracy and the longevity of democratic systems. The set of data covers 169 countries over a span of nearly two centuries, from 1815 to 2004. This dataset includes original measures of electoral contestation and participation, which are key dimensions in assessing the nature and impact of elections."

    "\n",
    "To understand the political systems of various countries over time, Miller developed methods to measure these two dimensions: participation and contestation. These dimensions help us see how democratic a country is by looking at different aspects of its political system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key method that Miller used was 'Principal Component Analysis' (PCA). An application of PCA is to aggregate multiple variables to create a new one. Intuitively, it tries to identify which pieces of data tend to vary together. For participation, Miller combined multiple measures of the size of the electorate as a percentage of the adult population. For contestation, Miller used nine different variables to construct the measure. Each variable was scaled to range between 0 and 1, where 1 represents a more democratic state. The variables were then aggregated to form the final contestation measure. Below are the variables and how they were combined:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vanhanenâ€™s Competition** (1815â€“2004):\n",
    "   - **Description**: This variable measures the percentage of legislative seats not held by the largest party. It's calculated as 100 minus the percentage of seats held by the largest party. Higher values indicate more competition.\n",
    "   - **Type**: **Objective**. This measure is based on quantitative data about legislative seat distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Freedom Houseâ€™s Political Rights** (1972â€“2004):\n",
    "   - **Description**: This variable assesses the level of political rights in a country, including the freedom to participate in the political process and the presence of fair elections.\n",
    "   - **Type**: **Subjective**. This measure is based on expert assessments and surveys regarding political rights.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cheibub, Gandhi, and Vreelandâ€™s Democracy** (1946â€“2004):\n",
    "   - **Description**: This is a dichotomous variable that indicates whether a country has electoral competition. It is a simple yes/no measure of whether elections are competitive.\n",
    "   - **Type**: **Objective**. This measure is based on a clear, binary classification of electoral competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **CIRIâ€™s Electoral Self-Determination and Banksâ€™ Party Legitimacy**:\n",
    "   - **CIRIâ€™s Electoral Self-Determination** (1982â€“2004): Measures the freedom of citizens to participate in elections.\n",
    "   - **Banksâ€™ Party Legitimacy** (1946â€“2003): Measures the legitimacy and freedom of party competition.\n",
    "   - **Type**: **Subjective**. Both measures are based on expert assessments and surveys about electoral freedom and party legitimacy.\n",
    "   - **Averaging**: These two variables were averaged to create a single measure reflecting the freedom of party competition and citizen lawmaking power.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Polityâ€™s Competitiveness of Participation and Polityâ€™s Competitiveness of Executive Recruitment**:\n",
    "   - **Polityâ€™s Competitiveness of Participation** (1815â€“2004): Measures how competitive the political participation is within a country.\n",
    "   - **Polityâ€™s Competitiveness of Executive Recruitment** (1815â€“2004): Measures how competitive the process of recruiting executive leaders is.\n",
    "   - **Type**: **Subjective**. These measures rely on expert coding of political competitiveness.\n",
    "   - **Averaging**: These two variables were averaged to form a single measure of political competitiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Polityâ€™s Executive Constraints and Banksâ€™ Legislative Effectiveness**:\n",
    "   - **Polityâ€™s Executive Constraints** (1815â€“2004): Measures the checks and balances on executive power.\n",
    "   - **Banksâ€™ Legislative Effectiveness** (1815â€“2003): Measures how effective the legislature is in governing.\n",
    "   - **Type**: **Subjective**. These measures are based on expert assessments of institutional constraints and legislative effectiveness.\n",
    "   - **Averaging**: These two variables were averaged to create a measure of intragovernmental constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Construction Method\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Averaging Similar Variables**:\n",
    "   - Variables that measure very similar political features were first averaged. For example, the average of CIRIâ€™s Electoral Self-Determination and Banksâ€™ Party Legitimacy provided a single measure for the freedom of party competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Aggregation**:\n",
    "   - The averaged variables were then aggregated to form the final contestation measure. This ensures that each aspect of contestation is appropriately represented without any single variable being double- or triple-weighted.\n",

However, your undergraduate research assistant has made errors in coding the data. Suppose you have three dimensions to measure democracy: Freedom of the Press, Electoral Fairness, and Political Participation. Let's assume the research assistant got the data for Freedom of the Press right but made significant errors in Electoral Fairness and Political Participation. \n",
