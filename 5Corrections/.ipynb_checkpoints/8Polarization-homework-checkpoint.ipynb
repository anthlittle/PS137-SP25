    "## Homework Notebook: Correcting Misperceptions _May Not_ Strengthen Democratic Norms in a Polarized Society\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we examine [James N. Druckman's article, \"Correcting misperceptions of the other political party does not robustly reduce support for undemocratic practices or partisan violence,\" published in PNAS in 2023](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2308938120). The study addresses a growing consensus that **misperceptions of the other party's beliefs contribute to support for undemocratic practices and partisan violence**. Specifically, it investigates whether providing people with accurate information about the other party's views can reduce their own support for such actions. The author notes that prior research (like the paper we examined in class!) indicates that partisans significantly overestimate the level of support for partisan violence (SPV) and undemocratic practices (SUP) among those in the opposing party. \n",
    "\n",
    "This paper qualifies the effectiveness of correcting misperceptions in strengthening democratic norms. We will find out the Druckman's answers by the end of this assignment!"

    "Druckman's study uses an experimental design to test the _robustness of misperception corrections_. We will explain more about these conditions later. First, let's look at the outcome variables: whether respondents themselves support partisan violence (SPV) against the out-party and whether respondents support their side using undermocratic parctices (SUP) against the outparty.\n",
