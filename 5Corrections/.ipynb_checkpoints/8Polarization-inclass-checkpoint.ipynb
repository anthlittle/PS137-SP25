    "## In-Class Assignment: Correcting Misperceptions to Strengthen Democratic Norms in a Polarized Society\n",
    "\n",
    "In this in-class assignment, we examine [a recently published paper in *Nature Human Behavior*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01594-w). The leading authors including a current graduate student and a faculty member in this very department!\n",
    "\n",
    "The article addresses the paradox of why voters who profess support for democracy often participate in its erosion. The authors identify a key mechanism they term the \"subversion dilemma\"—the belief that the opposing political faction is willing to undermine democracy encourages voters to tolerate anti-democratic actions by their own representatives. This dynamic perpetuates democratic backsliding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper's data structure is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Study 1: Observational data collected from 1,973 U.S. partisans. Measures included self-reported willingness to break democratic norms and perceptions of opposing partisans' willingness to do the same (7-item scale).\n",
    "* Study 2: Experimental data from 2,545 participants using an \"ask-tell\" method to correct misperceptions about opposing partisans' behaviors.\n",
    "    * Sub-study 2a: Focused on changing perceptions to shape subjects' attitudes on democratic attitudes.\n",
    "    * Sub-study 2b: Explored impacts on hypothetical voting decisions.\n",
    "* Study 3: Panel study with 1,848 participants to replicate findings and address concerns about social desirability bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we focus on study 2a."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:** Study 2 aimed to test if correcting misperceptions about opposing partisans' willingness to break democratic norms would affect partisans' own willingness to uphold these norms. This study builds on the idea that the belief that the other side will subvert democracy leads partisans to support subverting it themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Treatment Condition:**\n",
    "*   Participants were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group.\n",
    "*   The treatment group received an \"ask-tell\" intervention. After answering questions about how willing they thought the opposing partisans would be to subvert democracy, participants in the treatment group were told how the opposing partisans had actually responded.\n",
    "*   The control group answered the same questions about opposing partisans but did not receive any feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific actions to subvert democracy includes: banning rallies of the opposing party, ignoring court rulings favoring the opposing party, freezing social media accounts of journalists favorable to the out-party, reducing the number of voting stations at counties with predominant out-party members, changing laws to make it easier for their own side to get elected, using violence to block laws enacted by the out-party and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we focus on the self-reported willingness to subvert democracy outcome. This is measured using a seven-item scale, but asking about the respondents' own willingness to support actions undermining democracy.\n",
